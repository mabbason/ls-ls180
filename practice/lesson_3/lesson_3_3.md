# What is a conceptual schema?
It is a High level consideration of the database, what generally are we trying to accomplish with the organization of the data/database? How many general entities are we trying to represent? What might the ERD look like?

# What is a physical schema?
It is the detail surrounding the actual implementation. How many tables, what columns should they have, what constraints, where should the primary/foreign keys form a relationship?

# What are the three types of relationships that can be shown in a database diagram?
One-One
One-Many
